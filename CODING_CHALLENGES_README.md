# Coding Challenges Platform Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the Coding Challenges platform that has been implemented.

## What's Implemented

1. **Admin Interface for Challenges**

   - Create, edit, and manage coding challenges
   - Templates for common challenge types (Array Sum, Palindrome, etc.)
   - Category, tag, and difficulty management

2. **Challenge Browsing**

   - Grid layout with challenge cards
   - Filtering by difficulty, tags, and categories
   - Search functionality

3. **Lab Page for Solving Challenges**

   - Interactive code editor
   - Test runner with visual feedback
   - Success modal with recommendations

4. **User Progress Tracking**
   - Completion statistics by category and difficulty
   - Point system and streaks
   - Recommended challenges based on history

## Getting Started

### 1. Start Convex Development Server

```bash
cd /Users/marksikaundi/Documents/progress/101/beta
pnpx convex dev
```

This will start the Convex development server and generate the necessary TypeScript types.

### 2. Initialize Sample Challenges

1. Start your Next.js development server in a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/marksikaundi/Documents/progress/101/beta
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/admin/init-challenges` in your browser
3. Click the "Initialize Sample Challenges" button
4. After initialization, you will see links to view and manage the challenges

### 3. Using the Platform

- **Admin Interface**: `/admin/labs`
- **Challenge Browser**: `/challenges`
- **Solving Challenges**: `/lab?id=[challenge-id]`
- **User Dashboard**: `/dashboard`

## Implementation Notes

### Fixed Issues

1. **Seed Function**

   - Implemented labs_seed.ts with sample challenges
   - Connected init-challenges page to use the seed function

2. **Challenge Progress Component**

   - Fixed duplicate code in the component
   - Added temporary implementation for statistics without relying on API generation

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Added getUserStats and getByCategory functions to labs.ts
   - Created a script to generate Convex API types

### Pending Tasks

1. **Run Convex Generation**

   - Execute `pnpx convex dev` to properly include the challenge_progress module
   - Alternatively, run the provided script: `node scripts/generate-convex-api.js`

2. **Implement Leaderboard**

   - Create leaderboard specific to coding challenges

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test the entire challenge workflow from creation to completion
   - Verify progress tracking and recommendation engine

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter type errors related to Convex imports:

1. Ensure the Convex server is running with `pnpx convex dev`
2. Check that the \_generated folder exists in the convex directory
3. Try restarting your development server
