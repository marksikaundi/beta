### 2. Backend API (convex/changelog.ts)
- `getPublicChangelog()` - Fetch published changelog entries
- `getSystemStatus()` - Real-time platform status monitoring  
- `createChangelogEntry()` - Admin function to create new entries
- `updateChangelogEntry()` - Admin function to update existing entries
- `createSampleChangelogEntries()` - Development function for test data

### 3. Public Changelog Page (/changelog)
- System status widget with real-time updates
- Entry filtering by type (feature, improvement, bugfix, issue, maintenance, security)
- Responsive design with proper typography and spacing
- Issue resolution tracking and status indicators

### 4. Admin Management Interface (/admin/changelog)
- Form for creating and editing changelog entries
- Status tracking (draft, published, archived)
- Issue resolution management
- Sample data generation tools

### 5. System Status Widget
- Real-time platform status in header
- Popover with active issues and details
- Color-coded status indicators (operational, degraded, major-outage)
- Link to full status page

### 6. Navigation Integration
- "Status" link in main navigation
- Links to admin management from admin dashboard
- Proper authentication and role checking

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure development server is running: `pnpm run dev`
2. Sign in to the application (required for admin functions)
3. Have admin access (or modify admin checks temporarily for testing)

### Test Scenario 1: Public Changelog Access
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/changelog
2. **Expected**: 
   - Page loads without errors
   - System status widget displays current status
   - Empty state or existing entries display properly
   - Responsive design works on mobile

### Test Scenario 2: Sample Data Generation
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/admin
2. **Action**: Click "Create Sample Changelog" button
3. **Expected**: 
   - Success message appears
   - Sample entries are created in database
   - Confirmation of entries created

### Test Scenario 3: Admin Changelog Management
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/admin/changelog
2. **Test Creating Entry**:
   - Fill out the form with test data
   - Try different entry types (feature, bugfix, issue, etc.)
   - Test both draft and published status
   - Verify form validation
3. **Expected**:
   - Form submits successfully
   - New entries appear in admin list
   - Status indicators work correctly

### Test Scenario 4: System Status Functionality
1. **Create an issue entry** via admin panel:
   - Type: "issue"
   - Severity: "high" or "critical"
   - Status: "published"
   - Leave "isResolved" as false
2. **Check system status**:
   - Visit /changelog page
   - Check header status widget
   - Verify status changes to "degraded" or "major-outage"
3. **Resolve the issue**:
   - Edit the entry in admin panel
   - Set "isResolved" to true
   - Verify status returns to "operational"

### Test Scenario 5: Real-time Updates
1. **Open changelog in two browser tabs**
2. **Create/update entry in one tab**
3. **Verify real-time updates in second tab**
4. **Expected**: Changes appear immediately without page refresh

### Test Scenario 6: Entry Types and Filtering
1. **Create entries of different types**:
   - Feature announcement
   - Bug fix
   - Security update
   - Maintenance notice
   - System improvement
2. **Test filtering** on public page
3. **Verify proper icons and styling** for each type

## üéØ Expected Behaviors

### System Status Logic
- **Operational**: No active issues
- **Degraded**: Active issues with low/medium severity
- **Major Outage**: Active issues with high/critical severity

### Entry Types and Icons
- **Feature** (‚ö°): New functionality and capabilities
- **Improvement** (‚úÖ): Enhancements to existing features
- **Bugfix** (üîß): Fixes for reported issues
- **Issue** (‚ö†Ô∏è): Active problems affecting users
- **Maintenance** (üïê): Scheduled maintenance and updates
- **Security** (üõ°Ô∏è): Security-related updates and patches

### Status Indicators
- **Draft**: Entry saved but not public
- **Published**: Entry visible to all users
- **Archived**: Entry hidden from public view

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure user is signed in
2. **Admin Access**: Check if user has admin permissions
3. **Database Connection**: Verify Convex is connected
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Check for type mismatches

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Convex database connection
3. Test API endpoints in admin panel
4. Check network tab for failed requests
